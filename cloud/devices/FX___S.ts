// LG front-load washer sold in Korea. Retail model FX25VSR.AKOR2; it reports modelId "FX___S" (sw
// 2.11.246), which is what we match on - the underscores are LG's family wildcard, the same shape as
// F_V8_Y___W.B_2QEUK and 2REF11EIDA__4, so sibling FX models may report the same id. Whether their
// frame layout is identical has not been checked, and the diagnostic sensors below exist partly so a
// mismatch shows up as an unnamed value rather than as silently wrong state.
//
// This model does NOT share a layout with any of the existing washer handlers: F3L2CYU__/T1789EFH_F
// discriminate on buf[1]==0xEC with 25/27-byte records, the EU F_V*/Y_V* handlers parse a flat 80/53-byte
// frame. FX___S wraps everything in a second envelope and carries a 66-byte record. Everything below was
// derived from live captures (washer-capture-20260730.jsonl, washer-cycle-20260730.jsonl) taken while the
// owner drove the appliance and the LG app, naming each action as they made it; every value here is
// backed by an operation whose label was written down before the bytes were read.
//
// FRAMING. AABBDevice strips "AA <len8>" and "<cksum> BB", so buf[0] is the direction byte (0x20 from
// the appliance) and buf[1] is the message type. When the original length byte was 0xFF the real length
// is a 16-bit field that follows the type, which is how we tell the two forms apart:
//
//   short:     20 <type> <payload...>
//   extended:  20 <type> <len16> <payload...>          len16 == buf.length + 4
//
// Message types seen from the appliance, censused across all three washer captures with
// tools/aabb-survey.ts - the appliance sends thirteen and this handler dispatches on five:
//
//   0x0A  2184x   tunnel, see below
//   0x4D   527x   the appliance declaring its own course table, see processCourseTable
//   0xE6   136x   reply to a settings write
//   0x3E    90x   the appliance's own energy meter, one report every ~15 min, see
//                 processEnergyReport
//   0x72    23x   the notification channel, see processNotification. It sat in the "short acks"
//                 bucket below until 2026-08-07, when a capture put one of its values next to the
//                 LG cloud's own push for the same instant
//
//   0xD8   164x   one byte that follows the power state, sent unprompted. NOT used: it leads the
//                 state record by 16 s in one measured transition and trails it by 31 s in another
//   0xE2    29x   71 bytes, sent ten times over ~14 s, 30 s before a cycle reaches Complete - so
//                 there is one payload per completed cycle and no more. Decoded but NOT published:
//                 the course (@9 = @24), the four options as they were SELECTED (@5-@8, which the
//                 state record loses as it consumes them), the nominal minutes (@18 = @20) and the
//                 cycle's energy in Wh (@22, which agrees with 0x3E's total). Everything here is
//                 already published from frames that arrive sooner, except the as-selected options
//   0x31    11x   99 bytes, every byte identical in all eleven. A fixed declaration of something
//   0x88     2x   37 bytes, likewise constant

//                 one byte that is only ever 3 or 4
//
// TUNNEL (0x0A). payload = 00 <id16> 00 01 <flag> <inner> <innerlen16> 00 <data>
//   inner 0x03  6 or 17 bytes  heartbeat, ~1.5 s, only while powered on
//   inner 0xEC  134 bytes      state: <record 66B = previous> 00 <record 66B = current> <trailing byte>
//   inner 0x86/0x87            the app browsing the course table; read-only, not decoded

//                              arriving after 0xEC stops, so it is the better liveness signal.
//
// The stacked-record layout is not an assumption: across consecutive 0xEC frames the current record of
// frame N is byte-identical to the previous record of frame N+1.
//

//   11         running      all three washes, five times
//   40         detecting    all three washes, five times - the appliance re-senses mid-wash

//   14         spinning     all three washes
//   41         running      8/07, matched to 0.85 s - the same run's 0 -> 1 matched to 1.0 s
//   42         end          all three washes
//   47         refreshing   7/30, twice
//

// six transitions match to under a second once it is applied, including two that match exactly. A
// semantic mismatch would not be constant, which is why the offset is a clock and not a doubt.
//
// The cloud is the LABEL SOURCE, not the judge: our byte is the measurement and LG's name is what they
// call it. Renaming these to LG's vocabulary is deliberate - the same appliance is also visible through
// the official integration, and two names for one stage is worse than either name.
//
// LG's own model JSON for this appliance settles the rest. Its `MonitoringValue.state` declares 33
// states with an index each, and THE INDEX IS THIS BYTE: all twelve values ever measured here are
// declared, at exactly the number we measured, including the two that were pinned only by the clock
// alignment above (3 = DETECTING, 11 = RUNNING). Twelve of twelve, from a source that has no idea what
// we captured.
//
// So the values below that were never observed come from that declaration rather than from a guess,
// and they exist to stop a state this appliance can reach reading as `unknown`. Two are worth naming:
//
//   7   RESERVED    a delay-end reservation is set and counting down
//   16  END         a finished cycle. We only ever see 42, which the JSON calls
//                   END_REMOTE_MAINTAIN_ON - this owner leaves remote control on. A machine with it
//                   off looks likely to finish on 16 instead, which used to publish `unknown`.
//
// Where the JSON is finer than the cloud, the cloud's coarser word is kept, because matching the
// official integration is the whole point of this vocabulary: 37 is CLOTHING_RECOGNITION and 40 is
// POLLUTION_DETECTING, and the cloud reports both as `detecting`. 42 is END_REMOTE_MAINTAIN_ON and
// 47 is LAUNDRYCARE, reported as `end` and `refreshing`. 41 is TUB_CLEANING, reported as `running` -
// and that last one is not a choice between two words. The official integration's `options` list has
// 22 entries and `tub_cleaning` is not one of them, so there is no cloud vocabulary for it at all.
//
// 41 is also the warning this list carries. It was named TUB_CLEANING from the JSON alone and never
// checked against the cloud, because it had never been seen - and it is the one name here that turned
// out wrong the first time the appliance reached it (2026-08-07, a 통살균 run). Taking a NAME from the

 * Error codes, indexed by OFF_ERROR into LG's declared `MonitoringValue.error` - the same

 * naming the rest.
 *
 * The NAMES are the official integration's, not ours, for the reason the status vocabulary is
 * (see above STATUS): this appliance is visible through both, and two names for one fault is worse
 * than either name. That mapping is not a stretch - the official declares exactly nine error types,
 * and exactly nine of LG's declared codes have an unambiguous counterpart, nine for nine:
 *
 *   2  IE   급수 안됨          water_supply_error
 *   3  OE   배수 안됨          water_drain_error
 *   4  UE   탈수 안됨          out_of_balance_error
 *   5  FE   물높이 높음        overfill_error
 *   7  PE   물높이 감지 안됨   water_level_sensor_error
 *   8  TE   온도 감지 안됨     temperature_sensor_error
 *   9  LE   모터 회전 이상     locked_motor_error
 *   20 DE1  문 안닫힘          door_open_error            <- the measured one
 *   21 DE2  문 안잠김          unable_to_lock_error
 *
 * The remaining ten have no official counterpart, so they keep LG's own code as their name rather
 * than a description invented here. A code the JSON does not declare publishes `unknown_error`,
 * which exists for the same reason `unknown` does in STATUS: an event_type that is not in the
 * declared list is dropped by Home Assistant, so the fallback has to be declared too.
 *
 * ONE of these twenty has been observed. The other nineteen are named, not measured - which is the
 * safe half of what the model JSON can be used for, and phase 41 is in this file as the standing
 * reminder of the other half.

     * standby-only publish below and applies to six fields, not the two - latching only those two

     * Courses the select currently offers. Seeded from the named table, then grown from two sources:
     * the appliance's own declaration of its dial (processCourseTable), and any course seen in a state
     * record. Either way an unrecognised one is added under its number, so a dial position that was
     * never swept - or a sibling model's extra course - is selectable without waiting for the table to
     * be updated.

     * Nothing is ever removed, and the reasons changed under measurement on 2026-08-06.
     *
     * "Courses do not disappear from a dial" is FALSE - the dial is the owner's own selection, and
     * they took ten courses off it while this was running. But keeping them is better than it was:
     * a course that is off the dial can still be SELECTED by writing its number. Measured on three,
     * two of which are not the base of any extended course - 108 and 113 were accepted with status
     * 0x00 and came back in the record with their own default options. So the list outliving the
     * dial is not a list of dead entries; it is the appliance's full vocabulary, and Home Assistant
     * can reach courses the physical dial no longer offers.
     *
     * The other reason still holds on its own: dropping a course would break any automation naming
     * it.

     * and before the cycle. What settled the unit was the smart plug on this appliance's outlet:
     *
     *   2026-07-30, AI Wash    report 2 said 94   plug: 1880-2018 W for three minutes ~= 95 Wh,
     *                                             and its own kWh counter moved +0.10 in the window
     *   2026-08-04, Normal     cycle total 164    plug: +0.18 kWh over the cycle (+-10, it counts
     *                                             in hundredths), so ~180 Wh
     *
     * The appliance reads about 10% under the plug, consistently, which is what metering only the
     * heater and the motor rather than the whole appliance looks like. What is not in doubt is the
     * scale: the same cycle ran 28.7 minutes and the old decode published its total as "167 min".
     *
     * The counter resets to zero when a cycle starts - report 1 of the 2026-08-04 cycle carried
     * 140/140 - and keeps running afterwards while the appliance idles, at about 3 Wh per report.
     *
     * Cross-check, from a different frame: 0xE2 (sent 30 s before the cycle finishes) carries the
     * same total at @22. On 2026-08-04 both said 164, and 0xE2's two older samples - 128 and 33 -
     * each match their cycle's 0x3E cumulative at that moment. That field had been undecoded.
     *
     * Report 2 of that cycle arrived one second after the appliance reached Complete, which is
     * either the 15-minute cadence landing there by chance or the cycle end forcing a report. Two
     * readings, one sample, so it is not settled either way.
